## Image-equipped poll creation
OnePoll has been fitted with a feature to provide a URL to an image so that the question may be featured
with an image that may be critical to many polls such as mathematics, sciences, and business.

## Dynamic, mobile-friendly UX
The following screenshot was taken from an iPhone 6.
Wherever you try to use OnePoll, you are sure to have a pleasant user experience. Media queries have been
implemented to detect and optimize user experience for dynamic and mobile browsers.
